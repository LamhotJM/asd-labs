a. Explain how the Factory pattern can help here to solve this problem.
By separating the factory for production and test environment then
we don't need to modify AccountService and CustomerService.

AccountDAOImplement will be used in production, and MockAccountDAOImplement will be used in test environment.
ProdAccountDAOFactory will create AccountDAOImplement object while MockAccountDAOFactory will generate MockAccountDAOImplement object

Add an account for test environment

 AccountService accountService = new AccountServiceImpl(new ProdAccountDAOFactory());

Add an account for test environment
AccountService accountService = new AccountServiceImpl(new MockAccountDAOFactory());
